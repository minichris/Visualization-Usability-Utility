# Visualization-Usability-Utility
A tool for running in-browser information visualisation usability studies quicker and more accurately.

## What is it?
There will be a list of tasks the user will do in the list area. When they want to start a task, the click "start task", which will start a secret timer, open their web browser to a specific page, resize the browser window so this window and the browser window can be on the same screen.
When they think they have finished a task, they will press complete task, which will pause the timer and give them an "are you sure" dialogue box.
If they say no, the timer unpauses and they can continue.
If they say yes, the timer stops, a screenshot of their entire screen is taken, and then the time taken, task and their study participant ID number is sent to a server.
Then the task gets checked off in the list, and they can press "start task" again.
Task instructions are updated with the current task.
