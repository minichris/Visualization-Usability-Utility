# Visualization-Usability-Utility
A tool for running in-browser information visualisation usability studies quicker and more accurately.

## What is it?
A system that will ask a study participant to perform multiple different tasks using multiple different visualization systems from within their browser. 

The time taken to do each task with each visualization system will be recorded in the browser, and then sent back to a server-side database. 

Each visualization system will be designed around being served in a 500px square, to eliminate potential unfair advantages to use of space in different visualizations.

After they have done all of the tasks / visualization combinations, the system will ask them to rank each of the visualizations against each other on various scales. These ranks will also be sent back to the server-side database.
